Original Credit to Will Pearce for making this.
The code is posted as well on: http://roar11.com/2016/01/a-platform-independent-thread-pool-using-c14/
The code is explained well on the site so i recommend checking it out! 
I am posting this to act as a reasource for others wanting a thread pool without a bunch of libraries attached.
